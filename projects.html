<h3>LoRa Radio Frequency Train Braking System, Senior Design II Aeronix</h1>
<img src="Images/20250430_102313.jpg">
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborating within a group of 4 Electrical and 4 Computer Engineering students to create a dynamic Train Car braking system within a mesh network powered by LoRa Radio Frequency technology for low power consumption</li>
        <li>Each module in the mesh network will have GPS integration and use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to communicate the speed of each train car to ensure safe braking</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Checkers Playing Robot, Senior Design I</h1>
<img src="Images/20241202_175217.jpg">
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collaborating within a group of 3 Electrical and 2 Computer Engineering students to create a robot that plays checkers with a human and allows the human player to physically move pieces.</li>
        <li>The robot uses image recognition to recognize board updates and uses TensorFlow AI to decide the best possible move.</li>
        <li>The robot uses the CoreXY theory for smooth 8-directional movement.</li>
    </ul>
